### Project Title
**Python Data Science Nano Degree**

### Description
This project entails exploring data using Python related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
* Chicago
* New York City
* Washington

There is necessary `code` to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing _descriptive statistics_. There are also scripts that take in raw input to create an _interactive experience_ in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
